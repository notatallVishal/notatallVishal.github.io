# About ðŸ‘¤

Hi, My name's Vishal. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm concurrently pursuing my master's and bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/).  I love to learn and explore the deepest mysteries of computer architecture, quantum computation, and physics. 

I've gotten a strong foundation in digital design, physical design, and computer science from my time so far as an undergraduate. Along the way, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects such as, [[risc-v|RISC-V CPU]], a [[malloc|Dynamic Memory Allocator]], and a [[wireframe-renderer|Wireframe Render on an FPGA]]. Feel free to check some of my projects below:

>[!example] Project List
>- [[fpga-tetris|Tetris on FPGA]], May 2024
>- [[wireframe-renderer|Weak Projection Wireframe Renderer]], Summer 2024
>- [[opengl|OpenGL Renderer in C]], Summer 2024
>- [[malloc|Dynamic Memory Allocator]], October 2024
>- [[usb|USB v2 Recreation in SystemVerilog]], November 2024
>- [[risc-v|RISC-V CPU in SystemVerilog]], Spring 2025 (**In Progress!**)

When I'm not optimizing pipelines, catching up on semiconductor trends, or reading through interesting papers, you'll find me dabbling with ***graphic design, 3D modelling, and video editing***.
