title: üñ•Ô∏èRISC-V Core in SystemVerilog
---

```verilog
	initial begin 
		$display("Hello world!\n");
	end 
```
Project made mainly in #SystemVerilog, with simulators written in #C. And of course, there's some #RISC-V assembly code.

>[!warning] This project is currently in-progress! More to come soon.
